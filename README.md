A recreation and visualisation of Conway's Game of Life.   
Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life  
Currently its just rendered on a 50x50 grid of divs for 30 seconds which is pretty taxing already, and you really want a bigger it bigger than that. So for next iteration I'm probably going to use canvas instead.  
Just clone the repo or download the dist folder and open index.html and it should run.
