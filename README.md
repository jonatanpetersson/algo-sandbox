A recreation and visualisation of Conway's Game of Life.   
Read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life  
Currently its just rendered on a 50x50 grid of divs for 30 seconds which is pretty taxing already, and you really want a bigger it bigger than that. So for next iteration I'm probably going to use canvas instead.  
Also the rules for the game is set to take place on an infinite grid, so what happens when they reach the borders on a finite grid isn't stated, so that's something I'm also looking into.  
  
Just clone the repo or download the dist folder and open index.html and it should run.
